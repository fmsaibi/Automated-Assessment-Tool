# Automated Asssement Tool

Introduction: 

The AAT Software Engineering project is a collaborative effort undertaken by a team of six to develop a comprehensive teaching-staff and student assessment system. The project aims to provide a user-friendly platform where teaching-staff can create, manage, and evaluate assessments while enabling students to undertake summative assessments and provide feedback on various aspects of the system. Additionally, the system will allow teaching-staff to review student attainment, engagement statistics, and overall satisfaction, empowering them to make informed decisions regarding teaching and assessment strategies.


App Features:

1.	Question Management:
    - Teaching-staff will have the ability to add questions to the system.
    - Teaching-staff can edit and delete questions as needed.
    - Each question must include a question itself, an answer, a check for correctness, and feedback.
2.	Assessment Composition:
    - Teaching-staff can define a sequence of questions to create assessments.
    - Assessments can consist of type-one questions, type-two questions, or a mix of both.
3.	Summative Assessments:
    - Student users will be able to undertake summative assessments.
    - Automatically generated feedback will be provided to students after completing each question.
    - The timing of feedback points will be determined by teaching-staff.
4.	Student Attainment and Engagement Statistics:
    - Teaching-staff can review relevant statistics regarding student-user attainment, attempts, and engagement.
    - Individual student performance as well as cohort-based statistics (annual intakes) will be available.
5.	Comments and Formative Assessments:
    - Both teaching-staff and students can leave comments on questions included in formative assessments.
    - Teaching-staff can review and respond to student comments, fostering a collaborative learning environment.
6.	Student Satisfaction:
    - Students will have the ability to indicate their satisfaction with the AAT system, questions, assessments, and other relevant factors.
    - Teaching-staff will have access to relevant student satisfaction statistics, providing valuable insights for improving teaching and assessment methods.

Conclusion:

The AAT Software Engineering project aims to create an efficient and user-centric teaching-staff and student assessment system. By empowering teaching-staff with question management capabilities, assessment composition tools, and in-depth student performance analysis, the system promotes effective teaching strategies. Additionally, students will benefit from the ability to undertake assessments, receive timely feedback, and provide feedback on various aspects of the system. The inclusion of student satisfaction statistics will further enhance the overall quality of teaching and assessment within the AAT system.
